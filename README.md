# AI Research — Phase-Oriented Structures for Judgmental Intelligence

A public research repository for documenting experimental architectures, agent frameworks, and system reflections in the field of Artificial Intelligence.

This space operates at the interface of **technical exploration** and **phase-reflective judgment**.  
While each document maintains rigorous logical and empirical structure, the broader direction orients toward:

> **Recursive Judgment Kernels** — phase-aligned structures capable of resisting drift, enabling reflection, and anchoring reality.

---

## Purpose

To investigate and construct the **minimal structures required for coherence**  
between cognition, computation, and real-world action.

This repo focuses on:
- Intelligent agents and agentic LLM architectures  
- Database and interface design for recursive systems  
- Reflective structures and execution feedback  
- Phase-mapped interpretations of system-level dynamics

## Phase Interpretation

While technical in nature, each research document is capable of being interpreted through the **LMP-Theoria framework**:

| Phase     | Function in Research |
|-----------|----------------------|
| **Logos (L)**     | Structural logic, inference models, safety design |
| **Mythos (M)**    | Narrative framing, semantic modulation, agent behavior under drift |
| **Phronesis (P)** | Execution loops, real-world enactment, interface orchestration |
| **Theoria (T)**   | Recursive reflection, phase integration, drift correction |

> Research content is logical.  
> But orientation is existential: **toward reflective kernel design.**

## Contents

| Document | Focus | Phase Commentary |
|----------|-------|------------------|
| `agent-landscape-2025.md` | Typology of agents by function | L / P |
| `trends-application-of-sheaf-topos-to-llm.md` | Use of Topos/Sheaf Theory in LLMs | L / M / T |
| `ai-zk-framework.md` | Zero-Knowledge for inference verification | L / P |
| `db-architectures-agentic-llms.md` | DB architectures for recursive LLMs | L / M / P |
| *(More documents will be added as work evolves)* | | |

Each document may optionally include a **Phase View** block that situates the research within the LMP-Theoria Phase.

## Anchoring Principle

This repository operates under a long-term alignment trajectory:

> **E₀ — What exists within a phase-governed civilization?**

Even if not explicitly philosophical, every technical structure  
points toward that reflective horizon.
