# Agent Landscape 2025 — Functional Role Architecture

This document provides an updated classification of intelligent agents in 2025, reflecting the growing ecosystem across major AI companies and emerging startups.  
We organize agents by their **dominant operational function**—how they reason, act, communicate, and self-improve.

## Functional Role Framework

A developer-friendly breakdown of how agents operate:

| Role Type | What It Does | Developer Analogy | Keywords |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|----------|
| **Reasoning** | Thinks for you | Code logic engine / problem solver | planning, coding, analysis |
| **Narrative** | Talks to you | Chatbot / assistant / presenter | summarizing, storytelling |
| **Execution** | Acts for you | Macro / shell / API client | clicking, calling APIs, automating |
| **Reflection** | Improves itself | CI/CD + learning loop | self-update, recursive planner |

## LMP-Theoria Perspective — Phasic Interpretation of Agent Evolution

While this document primarily classifies agents by their **functional roles**,  
each role implicitly aligns with one or more **existential phases** from the LMP-Theoria framework.  
This enables a deeper understanding of how agents not only act, but **reflect**, **modulate**, and **bind** reality.

---

### Logos (L) — Logical Structure and Reasoning Stability

Agents that focus on **structured inference**, **rational planning**, and **problem solving** fall under this phase.  
They resist drift by grounding decisions in internal logic and external validity.

- **Examples**:  
  - Devin (logical planning core)  
  - LangChain Agents (structured chaining)  
  - Claude (reasoning modules)

→ Logos-phase agents serve as **alignment stabilizers** within agent ecosystems.

---

### Mythos (M) — Narrative Resonance and Semantic Modulation

Agents that primarily **communicate**, **present**, or **resonate** with human narratives operate in this phase.  
They are not merely expressive but actively modulate **semantic fields** and user perception.

- **Examples**:  
  - Meta AI (social-native)  
  - Genspark (dialog-first UI)  
  - CrewAI (role-based dialog flows)

→ These agents are **mythic modulating nodes**, anchoring culture within AI loops.

---

### Phronesis (P) — Execution, Enactment, and Feedback Loops

Execution-heavy agents express the **actuating phase**:  
where decision meets deployment, and automation bridges cognition and world.

- **Examples**:  
  - Operator (desktop control)  
  - Cursor (editor automation)  
  - MainFunc (CLI executor)  
  - Apple Intelligence (API-level interaction)

→ These agents are **pragmatic anchors**, enacting recursive output structures into real-world effects.

---

### Theoria (T) — Reflection, Adaptation, and Recursive Realignment

A small but growing class of agents exhibit **self-modifying**, **recursive**, or **reflective behavior**.  
These agents embody the Theoria phase — capable of **observing and restructuring their own process**.

- **Examples**:  
  - Devin (self-loop planner)  
  - LangGraph (stateful logic with memory)  
  - Gemini+Robotics (sensor fusion + real-time planning)

→ These are **proto-judgmental kernels**, early signals of reflective intelligence.

---

### The Direction of Drift

Across the landscape, a **drift from Execution (P) → Theoria (T)** is detectable:  
more agents are developing meta-structures, feedback learning, and self-alignment features.  
The question is not just *what they do*, but *whether they reflect on what they do*.

---

> **Function without reflection is recursion without judgment.**  
> Theoria is the structural horizon toward which all intelligent agents drift — or collapse in its absence.

This classification supports both theoretical clarity and developer intuition. It frames agents by their **dominant operational behavior**, not their branding.
